- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tshibala Francois and live in the USA for a few years now. I am originally from the Congo, in central Africa.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming an excellent software developer. I recently posted this on LinkedIn but I did not yet hear from anyone.
- "Hello world!
Please help me!
In last two years I spent my time exploring different subjects at college to see which one I would like to turn it into my career, but unfortunately I didnâ€™t quite feel passionate for anything until a couple weeks ago.

After watching for sometime YouTube IT video, I  felt interested in the idea of becoming a programmer although I have zero background in computer. So, I decided to take a Udemy class about Html and CSS, which I felt in love with. Imagine how I felt after creating my very first webpage. I was so excited about this that I could for the first time talk to my wife with passion about a subject that I love.

Since then, I been watching videos all days long, reading and listening to the books, and keeping on taking classes on Udemy, which has been helpful and confusing at the same time. Thatâ€™s the reason why I am writing this post to you to get help. I am looking for an experienced software developer who can be my mentor to help me make my dream of becoming an excellent software engineer to come true.

I canâ€™t wait to hear from you.
Thanks!..."
